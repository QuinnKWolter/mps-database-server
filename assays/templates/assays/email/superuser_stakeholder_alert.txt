Hello Admins,

The Acknowledgment Status of a Study has changed:

Study: {{ study }}
Link: https://mps.csb.pitt.edu{{ study.get_summary_url }}

{% for stakeholder in stakeholders %}{{ stakeholder.group }}: Acknowledged by {{stakeholder.signed_off_by.first_name}} {{stakeholder.signed_off_by.last_name}} on {{ stakeholder.signed_off_date}} {% if stakeholder.sign_off_required %}(Required){% else %}(Not Required){% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Thanks,
MPS
