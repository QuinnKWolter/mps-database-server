        <legend>Summary of the Important Information from the Table Above</legend>
        <li>When an assay plate map is in use by more than one data file/block (some files may have more than one block of data), correctly understanding what gets updated is essential to correct data processing. </li>
        <li>When samples are positioned the same way on an assay plate, and only the sample time is changing from file/block to file/block, the same assay plate map may be used for those file/blocks.</li>
        <li>When samples are positioned the same way on an assay plate, but there are different dilution factors, sample volumes, or sample collection duration times from file/block to file/block, an assay plate map must be made for each (only the sample time can change from file/block to file/block to use the same plate map).</li>
        <li>Sample times are associated to a specific file/block. Thus, editing a sample time will affect one and only one file/block.</li>
        <li>Raw values (imported from the plate reader file) are associated to a specific file/block. Raw values cannot be edited in the GUI. </li>
        <li>A standard's Method/Target/Unit is assigned to a plate map. </li>
        <li>Editing a sample time for one file/block, when a plate map has been used for multiple file blocks, will update the sample time only the one file/block. </li>
        <li>Editing the sample location for one file/block, when a plate map has been used for multiple file blocks, will change the sample location for ALL file/blocks associated to the plate map.</li>
