            Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the types of fatty liver which occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most extreme form of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common liver disorder in developed countries. NAFLD is related to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome and may respond to treatments originally developed for other insulin-resistant states (e.g. diabetes mellitus type 2) such as weight loss, metformin, and thiazolidinediones.

                “Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to more severe steatohepatitis with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH may further lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This map shows a stage-dependent progression of NAFLD. In the first stage of NAFLD, excess lipid accumulation has been demonstrated. The main cause is the induction of insulin resistance, which leads to a defect in insulin suppression of free fatty acids (FAAs) disposal. In addition, two transcription factors, SREBP-1c and PPAR-alpha, activate key enzymes of lipogenesis and increase the synthesis of FAAs in liver. In the second stage, as a consequence of the progression to NASH, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is enhanced due to oxidation stress through mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to lipid peroxidation. The lipid peroxidation can further cause the production of cytokines (Fas ligand, TNF-alpha, IL-8 and TGF), promoting cell death, inflammation and fibrosis. The activation of JNK, which is induced by ER stress, TNF-alpha and FAAs, is also associated with NAFLD progression. Increased JNK promotes cytokine production and initiation of HCC.” –KEGG Disease Description

            The NAFLD Clinical Drugs and Trials page consists of pre-curated preclinical and clinical databases that contain information about the NAFLD disease phenotype. You can find information about different studies that have been completed looking at NAFLD. This page also looks to make it easier to address the important studies that convey the ADMET and MOA processes with drugs that have been determined relevant to NAFLD. NAFLD currently has 574 clinical trials in all phases across world, the United States makes up 234 of those studies. Of all the 574 clinical trials, 296 drug intervention studies have been explored for the abetment of the disease state. There are also thousands to clinical samples for testing from NIDDK. Preclinical models number in the thousands and range from mice models to organ on a chip models.

        The NAFLD Disease Model page is where you can go to find all information relevant to microphysiology systems models related to NAFLD. Here you can also find the studies associated with these models. Currently, the MPS Database is the warehouse for these models. There have been various organ models aiming to describe the NAFLD disease state.
